ioDoom3 is based on the Doom 3 Source Code and therefore uses the same license.

> ⚠️ **Note:** ️️️️The game data included with demo templates each have their own separate license. Please refer to the documentation in each demo template folder for specific licensing details.

Doom 3 Source Code is free software: you can redistribute it and/or modify
it under the terms of the GNU General Public License as published by
the Free Software Foundation, either version 3 of the License, or

See [LICENSE.md](LICENSE.md) for the GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE Version 3, 29 June 2007.

See [LICENSE_EXCEPTIONS.md](LICENSE_EXCEPTIONS.md) for all parts of the code that are not covered by the GPL.

> ⚠️ **Note:** ️️️️ Keep in mind that the GPL license will lock you out of the console markets because you can't use proprietary APIs covered by NDAs. However you can sell your game on Steam without problems and there are already Doom 3 engine based games in the Steam marketplace.
